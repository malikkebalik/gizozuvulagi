She is popularly known as the younger sister of former ‘One Direction’ member and current famous singer <a href=#>Zayn Malik</a>.</h3><p>She has also shown up in One Direction’s 3D concert movie, named “This Is Us” as herself.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_are_the_parents_of_Safaa_Malik></span>Who are the parents of Safaa Malik?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Safaa Azad Malik was <strong>born</strong> on September 13, 2002. She was born and raised in Bradford, England, hence, she holds British nationality.</p><p>As of 2022, she will be 19 years old and falls under the zodiac sign of Virgo.</p><p>She belongs to a Muslim-British ethnicity as her dad was Muslim. She follows Islam religion after as her father is British- Pakistani.</p><p>Speaking of her family, her father’s name is Yaser Malik and her mother’s name is Trisha Malik. Trisha is a Brtish who worked as a “halal” chef at a local primary school and cooked meals for Muslim children.</p><p>Safaa has four siblings including Zayn Malik. The oldest sibling is Doniya Malik, the second oldest is <a href=#>Zayn Malik</a>, and the third child is Waliyha Malik, making Safaa the youngest. She also has cousins named Aaroosa, Sashaa, Sarooha, Palvisha, and Zarish.</p><p>As for her <strong>educational</strong> background, she also attended Tong High School like Zayn. Other information on her previous primary schools is not given as of now.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Safaa_Malik_Profession_Career></span>Safaa Malik: Profession/ Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Safaa is a social media sensation. She gained fame as the youngest sister of the singer Zayn Malik. She has always been a huge fan and supporter of her brother since the beginning of One Direction.</p><p>Safaa is a camera-shy girl and rarely attends Zayn’s concerts. Even when she does attend, she is careful enough to keep herself away from the camera.</p><p>She is a very opinionated person and always expresses herself online openly. Safaa is the greatest supporter of Zayn Malik and she openly conveys her thoughts on any rumors or headlines surrounding Zayn.</p><p>Once when Zayn broke up with his girlfriend, Gigi Hadid, Safaa uploaded an arguable message on her Instagram. The post included a caption that went “Horrible people get nowhere”.</p><p>Right after she posted it, her comment section was filled with a lot of hate comments. As her post did not clearly show who she was referring to, a lot of them wanted to know who was this ‘Horrible person’.</p><p>But since the post was posted right after Zayn’s break up a lot of people knew who she was talking about. Few of her fans defended her and appreciated her love and support for her brother’s decisions.</p><p>This was not the first time she posted opposing Gigi Hadid, she once called Gigi “that girl” on her Instagram post. This led the fans to guess that they did not have a good relationship.</p><p>Moreover, she also has a collaborative Youtube channel named ‘Safaa and Aleena’. They began their journey on May 12, 2020.</p><p>The channel has gained around 7.20k subscribers. They have posted four videos till now. They are titled ‘NEVER HAVE I EVER!’, ‘GET READY WITH US!!!’, ‘GET TO KNOW US TAG:)!’, and ‘Head Phone Challenge’.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Safaa_Malik_Awards_Nominations></span>Safaa Malik: Awards, Nominations<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She has not achieved any Awards and Nominations till now. But she is sure to achieve some awards or nominations once she is recognized well.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_is_Safaa_Malik%E2%80%99s_net_worth></span>What is Safaa Malik’s net worth?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Safaa Malik being the sister of Zayn must earn a decent amount. She has a <strong>net worth</strong> estimation of approximately <strong>$1 million</strong> to <strong>$3 million.</strong></p><p>However, her source of income is not given as of now. Whereas, her brother, Zayn Malik has a net worth of around $65 million as of 2021.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Safaa_Malik_involved_in_any_rumors_and_controversies></span>Is Safaa Malik involved in any rumors and controversies?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Safaa being Zayn’s young sister has been the center of quite a few controversies and rumors.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Safaa%E2%80%99s_Marriage_Controversy></span>Safaa’s Marriage Controversy<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Safaa married her boyfriend at the age of 17. After three days she was married to her boyfriend and was rumored pregnant which gave rise to many questions about her age and why Zayn didn’t attend the wedding.</p><p>However, Safaa Malik answered those questions through her Twitter account saying it was her decision. She Tweeted-</p><p>“I’ve decided to say this because 1) if you think I am fake, feel free to unfollow 2) just because I’m 17 I can’t make mature decisions now can I? it was my choice to keep the baby & it’s my choice to get married. It shouldn’t bother you guys. It’s my decision not yours!”</p><p>But we aren’t sure if this was her actual account as someone replied claiming it was a fake account. Even so, we have no answer as to why Zayn was not present at her wedding. It could be because the artist was simply too busy to make time for the event or he didn’t think of it as an important event.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Safaa%E2%80%99s_Baby%E2%80%99s_Death_threats></span>Safaa’s Baby’s Death threats<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Safaa once received a hate comment followed by a death threat on her five-month-old baby daughter Zeneyah online. She then screenshots it and posts it on her story.</p><p>The screenshot left everyone disgusted and disappointed in the netizen. In the screenshot, Safaa’s friend replied to the hater who called her baby Zenayah ugly.</p><p>The hater further continued and said she got married to cover the fact that she was pregnant. In defense of Safaa, she replied “I’m not Safaa but who the f**k are you to say anything about her or Zaneyah and how she wants to live HER life. Freak.”</p><p>And the hater shamelessly replied, “When her kid dies you’ll listen lol. Hope her kid dies it’s ugly anyway.” In her story, she captioned the screenshot with “What a disgusting world!!”</p><p>Safaa’s friend stated that she has been getting hate for no reason. She wrote on her Instagram post-</p><p>“If you have nothing nice to say then keep it to yourself. If you can’t say things to her in person don’t say it off fake accounts and don’t say you love her brother because if you did, you wouldn’t be sending hate to Safaa or any of her family,”</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Safaa%E2%80%99s_April_Fools_Day%E2%80%99s_Prank></span>Safaa’s April Fools Day’s Prank<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Safaa received a comeback from fans for her April Fools prank about a fake second pregnancy announcement. As soon as her story got reported, her comeback got worse as she posted saying ‘HAHAHAHAHA April Fools went too far.’</p><p>One offended fan wrote, ‘<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">As if S</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">afaa</span>&nbsp;<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Malik</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">&nbsp;pretended she was pregnant for an&nbsp;</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">April fools</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">&nbsp;joke …. sick’&nbsp;another put,&nbsp;‘NOT&nbsp;<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">SAFAA</span>&nbsp;<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">MALIK</span>&nbsp;DOING A&nbsp;<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">APRIL FOOLS</span>&nbsp;SAYING SHE’S PREGNANT&nbsp;</span>ANYONE WHO JOKES ABOUT PREGNANCY, SUICIDE, COMING OUT, BEING TRANS OR ANYTHING U ARE DISGUSTING’ and a third one simply said, ‘Safaa why?’</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Height_Weight_Body_measurement></span>Height, Weight, Body measurement<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Safaa stands tall at a <strong>height</strong> of 62 inches (5ft 2 inches, 160 cm) and <strong>weighs</strong> 60 kg.</p><p>She has a fit maintained body type.
