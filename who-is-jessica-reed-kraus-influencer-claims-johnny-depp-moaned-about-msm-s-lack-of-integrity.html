The influencer, Jessica Reed Kraus, has reportedly said that the ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’ star spoke about “death of journalistic integrity” as he prepared himself to face Heard in the Virginia court.</p><p>In a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Substack</a> post, Kraus reportedly wrote on Tuesday, June 21, that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Depp</a> told her, “I don't know you, but I know, just by the words you use and the aesthetic in your work, that I trust you.” She then noted that the 59-year-old <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">actor</a> “touched briefly on the Rolling Stone article that shredded his reputation and ruined his trust in media. A betrayal he hasn't yet recovered from.” The Rolling Stone article that Depp mentioned to the self-proclaimed writer was reportedly from 2018, titled ‘The Trouble With <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Johnny Depp</a>’, and which spoke in length about his “multimillion-dollar lawsuits, a haze of booze and hash, a marriage gone very wrong and a lifestyle he can’t afford.”</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eve Barlow warns Marilyn Manson accuser Evan Rachel Wood she'll now be targeted after Amber Heard</a></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'GORGEOUS!': Fans go gaga as Johnny Depp takes stage CLEAN-SHAVEN for Finland show</a></p><p>Kraus, who claimed that she got connected with Depp through "an old friend of” him, also said that she and the A-lister had a conversation on his “tendency to trust the wrong people, and the trouble it's caused him in various periods throughout his life”. She was apparently staying at the same <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hotel</a> where Depp and his team were staying during the trial and also attended every proceeding of the court that began on April 11 and ended on June 1. She also gained thousands of followers while posting about the trial, often criticizing Heard.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/10f37f72-aa88-42a7-83a4-f6370321e7d8.jpg><p>She wrote: “I'm hanging out with his friend for six weeks, so I'm listening to FaceTimes between them. Basically, all these phone calls with celebrities that call in to check in on him, which became a very cool kind of angle because it kind of just made him a regular guy. All these people talking about him like he's just their friend.”</p><p>Kraus told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Insider</a> that she personally met ‘The Rum Diary’ star at a cocktail party, which was thrown after his testimony in court. She said that Depp was surprised by the kind of attention the trial was getting. “He's so naive. He didn't even understand, on those phone calls, how viral every part of the trial was, because he is not really on social media,” she noted.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/566b6a9c-c2a0-4a6c-8e9a-81c8bfd8258d.jpg><p>The Instagram influencer also stated in her Substack post that Depp “thanked her ‘for caring enough to carve it with intention,’ unlike media organizations that have ‘failed him so many times before.’” She then added that after speaking with Depp, she understood him as “smart, curious, funny and polite”. “Prone to shifting into character voices exactly as one might expect from the Johnny Depp we know onscreen. But other than that, he is humble, down to earth, and incredibly attentive,” Kraus remarked.</p><p>However, it’s not the first time Kraus has made news as earlier, she posted a video of Courtney Love thanking Depp for saving her life. Love was heard saying in it, “I just want to tell you that Johnny gave me CPR in 1995 when I overdosed outside the Viper Room.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRooZ6owaKz0ZqkZqGem7m2sc2cnKtlk6GuqrnSZqGooJ6jxm6wxKmnZquclrquscNmpJqhnqjBs7HApmSmnZSerm6uxJ%2Bmq51dmbKnrcyaq6KnnmLBs7XApQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./about-jonathan-cain-s-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="About Jonathan Cains Net Worth">&larr;
