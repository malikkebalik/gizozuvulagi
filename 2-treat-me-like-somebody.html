The lyrics express the desire for a partner who is real, worth the time and effort, and accepts the flaws of the singer instead of trying to change or control them. The singer has been trying to find love in a world that can be cold and unfeeling. The singer does not ask for perfection but someone who can love and treat them with respect and honesty. The chorus emphasizes this desire for a relationship that is loving, accepting, and different from the superficial and unfulfilling relationships she has had in the past.</p><br><p>The singer recognizes that in the past, she was searching for something that did not last, and she was with the wrong people for the wrong reasons. The singer acknowledges that she was looking for a thrill rather than a genuine connection. The song reflects the singer's desire for someone who will keep it real with her and not just be with her for their own selfish reasons. The song offers a message of hope that there is someone out there who will treat her like somebody and not just like anybody.</p><br><p>Overall, the song is a powerful message about finding love and acceptance. It is a reminder that everyone deserves to be treated with respect and love, and it encourages listeners to hold out for the love and partnership that they deserve.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Somebody real is hard to find</u><br>It's difficult to find someone who is genuine.</p><br><p><u>Somebody worth all your time</u><br>Someone who is deserving of your time and attention.</p><br><p><u>Somebody who can tell you the truth</u><br>Someone who is honest with you.</p><br><p><u>Someone who loves you for you</u><br>Someone who loves you for who you are.</p><br><p><u>Someone who knows all of your flaws &</u><br>Someone who is aware of your imperfections.</p><br><p><u>Doesn't impose, try to control them</u><br>Does not try to change you or control your actions.</p><br><p><u>Let's you be free</u><br>Allows you to be yourself.</p><br><p><u>Doesn't deceive and</u><br>Does not lie to you.</p><br><p><u>Gives you a chance to believe</u><br>Provides an opportunity to believe in something.</p><br><p><u>Believe in something</u><br>Have faith in something.</p><br><p><u>Is that too much?</u><br>Is it too demanding?</p><br><p><u>'Cause I've been on the search and I'm losing my hope</u><br>I've been looking for a while but I'm losing faith.</p><br><p><u>Trying to find love in a world so cold</u><br>Trying to find love in a harsh and unfeeling world.</p><br><p><u>You ain't got to be perfect</u><br>You don't have to be flawless.</p><br><p><u>Just give me a purpose to love</u><br>Just give me a reason to love you.</p><br><p><u>To treat me like somebody</u><br>To treat me with value.</p><br><p><u>Won't be like everybody</u><br>Will not treat me the way everyone else does.</p><br><p><u>All you got to do is love me for me baby</u><br>Just love me for who I am.</p><br><p><u>Now don't be mislead by the things that I said in the past</u><br>Don't be fooled by my previous actions or words.</p><br><p><u>I was young</u><br>I was not mature.</p><br><p><u>I was looking for a thrill</u><br>I was seeking excitement.</p><br><p><u>That didn't last long</u><br>It was not sustainable.</p><br><p><u>I was in it for the wrong</u><br>I had the wrong intentions.</p><br><p><u>Wrong reason, wrong season, wrong person (yeah)</u><br>I was with the wrong person at the wrong time for the wrong reasons.</p><br><p><u>'Cause he just wanted one thing</u><br>My partner had ulterior motives.</p><br><p><u>And I just wanted something to smile at, and live for, and hug on (ohh)</u><br>I just wanted someone to bring me happiness and love.</p><br><p><u>I'd rather have quality than quantity</u><br>I prefer a smaller number of high-quality relationships to many meaningless ones.</p><br><p><u>Maybe I'm asking for too much</u><br>Perhaps my expectations are unrealistic.</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © Universal Music Publishing Group<br>Written by: TRINITY LAURE'ALE HOME</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maIyZo7hwfo2Yi6udkamsjrG%2BhaCknY%2BIvK6xwaibsg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./chain-breaks-pulling-jeep-video-viral-the-talks-today.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chain Breaks Pulling Jeep Video Viral The Talks Today">&larr;
