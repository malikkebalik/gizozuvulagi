The meeting was reportedly arranged by a friend of the couple who thought they could hit it off.</p><p class=dh>The two lovebirds tied the knot later in 1995 and would go on to have four kids together.

She was later diagnosed with stage III chondrosarcoma.</p><p class=dh>In the months that followed, Cool J remained by her side, offering her much needed support as she battled for her life — an experience she claims drew them closer to one another.</p><p class=dh>"You don't abandon someone in that foxhole, you know," the rapper stated during an <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.oprah.com/own-oprahs-next-chapter/why-ll-cool-js-wife-dislikes-doin-it-video>interview with Oprah</a>. Speaking further, he added that the situation was one that prompted him to make some sacrifices concerning his career so he could be with his wife.</p><p class=dh>Although <a class="me a" href=#>Cool J</a> and his wife have maintained a healthy relationship since their marriage, they don't often see eye to eye on all things. Simone opened up about one such occurrence during her meeting with talk show host Oprah Winfrey.</p><p class=dh>According to Simone, the rapper had shown her a video of one of his songs where an unknown woman reportedly licks him across the side of his face — a gesture she did not find as exciting as he had.</p><p class=dh>"I didn't talk to him for two weeks, I was so upset over that video," she says <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://youtu.be/3Pcrasl6trU>during a sit-down with Oprah Winfrey</a>. She also added afterward that Cool J repented, and all was well in paradise once again.</p><p class=dh>Before the conclusion of her interview with Oprah, Simone also revealed the secret behind their <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://heavy.com/entertainment/2017/12/ll-cool-j-kids-wife-simone-smith-children/>long-lasting marriage</a> — "Definitely putting God first, picking your battles and respecting each other."</p><p class=dh>The lovebirds are expected to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary in August later this year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpwbW5oaHqtuIycpqikXZ%2FAbsPIn5xmq5iWv6a%2FjK2fq6enl66kt4ypn6isn2LBb7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./naomi-watts-bio-wiki.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Naomi Watts  Bio (Wiki) ">&larr;
