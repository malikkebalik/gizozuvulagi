At the time of his son's arrival, Derulo had been dating Frumes for almost a year. They had&nbsp;started dating in April 2020 and <a href=# rel=follow>announced the pregnancy</a> on March 29, 2021.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The hit singer took to Instagram to post a romantic video, which featured them walking around a beach and enjoying the sunset together. The end of the clip showcased "Coming Soon," written in the sand. And in the caption, the Florida native&nbsp;shared he was excited to start a new chapter in his life.&nbsp;</p><p>Two months after the announcement, they gave <a href=# rel=follow>birth to their baby boy</a>. "The happiest day of my life bringing our baby boy (Jason King Derulo) home," Derulo wrote in the first Instagram video featuring his son. He added his son was lucky to get a strong, caring Frumes for his mother.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>As the new parents had started a family of their own within a short period of their relationship, their fans had assumed they would soon get married. But to everyone's dismay, the duo parted amicably in September 2021. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Jason <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">announced the split</a> through his tweet, writing, "Jena and I have decided to part ways." He praised her as an amazing mother before stating that the separation would allow them to be the best version of themselves and "the best parents we could be."&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Besides Frumes, Derulo has been romantically linked to multiple women, including Carmen Ortega and&nbsp;Daphne Joy. But he has married none of them. That being said, he was once admittedly close to having a wife.&nbsp;</p><h2>Jason Derulo Almost Had A Wife</h2><p>Derulo was once in a serious relationship with fellow singer-songwriter Jordin Sparks Thomas, the winner of American Idol season six. The pair started dating in August 2011 and became the 'it' couple in the industry.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But after three years, they separated in September 2014. In the immediate aftermath, neither Derulo nor Sparks shed light on the reason behind their split. But rumors became rife that the 'Savage Love' singer had cheated on his girlfriend.&nbsp;</p><p>When push came to shove, Derulo finally opened up about the reason during an interview with&nbsp;KIIS FM in September 2014 (<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reported by People</a>). "Every relationship has ups and downs when you stop having more good times than bad times, it's time to call it quits," he shared at the beginning of the conversation.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Then he clarified that their busy schedules&nbsp;and the pressure of marriage led to their separation. In his own words, he and Sparks were on&nbsp;different pages about getting married.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"It was a situation where there was a lot of arguing going on. Different pressures of marriage, not just from her perspective, but from the world in general," the 32-year-old elaborated. He then claimed he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">recorded his single</a>, 'Marry Me' because of the pressure. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As per his accounts, Derulo wanted to say through the song&nbsp;they had time to get married, and they needn't rush. "There's NO rush. When the time is right, I will say, 'will you marry me?'" he stated.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>However, the argument about being husband and wife in their early 20s turned out to be the last straw. In consequence, they ended their year-long relationship.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKKRqLyvecOeqa6kn2LEqrLEZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jerry-kelly-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jerry Kelly Net Worth">&larr;
