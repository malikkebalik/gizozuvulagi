The Hawaii-born actor's wife is&nbsp;actress Lisa Bonet and they have been married since October 2017. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>They started their relationship in 2005 and subsequently welcomed their two children:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Lola Iolani Momoa</a>, born in 2007, and&nbsp;Nakoa-Wolf Momoa, born in 2008.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>In a&nbsp;recent <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">conversation with&nbsp;ET's Lauren Zima</a>,&nbsp;Momoa&nbsp;shared his thoughts about his kids' careers and the possibility of them landing in Hollywood. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Doesn’t Want Kids to Be Actors</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>In the interview, the <a href=# rel=follow>Game of Thrones</a> actor revealed that one of his two kids wanted to become an actor. But when he was asked if he was happy about that, he replied, "I'm not a fan... I don't want them to." <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>Momoa explained himself by saying that he was&nbsp;hesitant to encourage that particular career.</p><p>If they [really] want to, maybe. But I don't want them to get into acting. It's very hard on people and I don't want them to have that pressure. I'm tough, I can handle it, but I wouldn't want to put someone I love [through] that.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The Sweet Girl star&nbsp;added he loved&nbsp;storytelling,&nbsp;theatrical things,&nbsp;directing, and filmmaking, but still hoped his 14 and 12 years old kids would chase other ambitions in their lives. He was also determined to&nbsp;try his "damnedest" to keep them&nbsp;away from acting. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Struggled to Show His Full Range</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>If one thinks the journey to&nbsp;Hollywood fame and success was easy for&nbsp;Momoa, they might be wrong.</p><p>That is because even after his breakthrough role as the Great&nbsp;Khal Drogo in&nbsp;HBO's fantasy epic&nbsp;Game of Thrones, many people thought he could not speak English, keeping him away from getting acting roles.</p><p>"I mean, where do you put Drogo? He’s not going in a rom-com. No one even knew I spoke English,"&nbsp;the 42-year-old said&nbsp;during an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with&nbsp;Esquire</a> in October 2019. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He further stated that he was surprised not to get works easily and had to struggle to show his full range as an actor.</p><h2>Due Bills and Joblessness</h2><p>The reason why&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Momoa</a> doesn't want his children to be actors can be sketched through his past experiences in the industry.</p><p>While he said he was initially not considered as a versatile actor to be in movies or TV shows, he has also repeatedly shared the story&nbsp;of him and his family starving just after his role ended in&nbsp;Game of Thrones. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"I mean, we were starving after&nbsp;Game of Thrones," the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">actor told InStyle</a> magazine in November 2020. "I couldn’t get work. It’s very challenging when you have babies and you’re completely in debt." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But things completely changed for the&nbsp;Momoa family when he was cast in 2016's&nbsp;Justice League. Following that, he acted in a title role in&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Aquaman</a>, and by that time, he had given some of his best works and proved to be an asset to his producers.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Today, he fits in everywhere — either playing a protective family man in&nbsp;Sweet Girl, a skilled warrior&nbsp;in See, or a heartthrob&nbsp;in Dune. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKKRqLyvecyopKiZXaC2pb%2BMsKCfnV2YrrOxxKtloaydoQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./juju-smith-schuster-bio-wiki.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="JuJu Smith Schuster  Bio (Wiki) ">&larr;
