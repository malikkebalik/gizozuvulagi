It is amazing that this 49-year-old mother of four has managed to keep her body in such a perfect shape.</p><p>She has four daughters with her Italian husband Joe Giudice who is a construction builder and restaurant owner. The eldest daughter Gia is 21 years old.</p><p>The other 3 daughters are Gabriella, Milania, and Audriana. It was not long back when Teresa Giudice’s 71-year-old mother, Antonia Gorga expired.</p><p>Her husband Joe Giudice is also presently serving 41 months of jail term for bank, mail, wire, and bankruptcy fraud since March 2016.</p><p>“Loving the sun,”</p><p>she says as she enjoys her frozen drinks on the beach in her one-piece bikini.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/teresa-featured-1.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Joe%E2%80%99s_rumored_affairs_and_%E2%80%98Made_for_each_other%E2%80%99_couple></span><u>Joe’s rumored affairs and ‘Made for each other’ couple</u><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Teresa Giudice’s family emigrated from Italy and settled in New Jersey, USA.

Though the couple has been putting on a united front, Joe’s ‘cheating scandals’ have hit the tabloids repeatedly.</p><p>It was said that he was in romantic involvement with their daughters’ nanny, Nicole Cemelli. Nicole is a college graduate who was hired to take care of their children.</p><p>But while Teresa Giudice was at work, Joe used to be at home alone with Nicole Cemelli. Things had progressed to the extent that both could barely keep their hands off of each other.</p><p>Besides, Nicole Cemelli had also kissed Joe on his lips in the presence of Teresa Giudice. Nicole was sacked in summer 2010 but it was rumored that Joe and Nicole were still in touch with each other.</p><p>Even when Teresa Giudice was serving her 15 months jail term on financial fraud charges, Joe was sighted with multiple ‘mystery women’ on different occasions.</p><p>In spite of several glaring proofs of her husband’s infidelity, Teresa Giudice has decided to overlook them.

Praising his wife of 17 years, Joe says:</p><p>“Our marriage has always been strong. We never had a problem with our marriage. But I definitely learned to appreciate her more not having her around for a year.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/sexy-mother.jpg><p>You may like to read <a class=row-title href=# aria-label="“Heartbreaking news!
