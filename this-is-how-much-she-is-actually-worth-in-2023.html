You can catch her on the TLC reality television series Long Island Medium.</p><h2><strong>How Theresa Caputo Made Her $3 Million Net Worth</strong></h2><p>The genesis of all her wealth points to her gift as a psychic which has led to other career paths. As such, Theresa Caputo’s net worth was not made through a single means.</p><h3><strong>Psychic Ability</strong></h3><p>According to the Long Island-born spirit medium, she started sensing the dead when she was about 4 years old, something that has become normal in her family. However, it was in her 20s that she began helping people with her gift by acting as a medium of communication between the living and the dead.</p><p>Before she fully embraced her gifts, Caputo suffered anxiety and it was so serious that her mom had to take her to a spiritual healer who made her realize she was suffering because she suppressed the Spirit.</p><p>The spiritual healer taught her ways to channel her energy to communicate with Spirit. After accepting her gift, she began to heal from anxiety and subsequently dedicated her life to helping people who have lost their loved ones by getting a message from the dead. She tours the United States for her live show termed Theresa Caputo Live The Experience. the spirit medium is fulfilled with her ability to bring comfort to her clients, knowing that their deceased loved ones are happy in the afterlife.</p><h3><strong>TLC Series, Long Island Medium</strong></h3><p lang=en dir=ltr>TICKETS ON SALE NOW ????️ Join us when the star of of TLC's Long Island Medium, <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">@Theresacaputo</a> Live! The Experience, comes face-to-face with her fans to deliver healing messages from departed loved ones to the audience LIVE at The Show on February 4, 2022.✨<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/V3R3pyxTOW</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/PYElPKG7KX</a></p><p>— Agua Caliente Casinos (@AguaCalienteRM) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">February 3, 2022</a></p><p>One of the major sources of Theresa Caputo’s net worth is her stint as a reality TV star. The idea to take her ability to the television world was conceived by her friend Victoria Woods who told her she was made for the screen. Besides, it sounded like the perfect way to share her gift with the rest of the world.</p><p>Subsequently, Long Island Medium debuted on September 25, 2011, on TLC. The TLC hit series has up to 14 seasons but new episodes are not being filmed at the moment. The last one aired on December 13, 2019.</p><p>The location of the show is Theresa Caputo’s home in Hicksville, New York, where her personal life and how she combines her duties as a mom, wife, and medium are filmed for audiences. Her clients who appear on the show are picked based on availability and if they are comfortable being on TV.</p><p>Giving readings and attending to her personal life is not all Theresa does on The Long Island Medium, she’s also cashing in on it. According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>reports</a>, the psychic made a cool $25,000 for each episode of Long Island Medium. Considering she was in all the episodes and there were more than 100 episodes filmed, a rough estimate suggests she bagged $2.5million from the show.</p><h3><strong>She Has Authored Four Books</strong></h3><p>The ability to communicate with the spirits has changed Theresa Caputo’s life in many ways and she is using her ability to change other people’s lives. Writing books is one of the ways she has chosen to share her gift and of course make more money.</p><p><strong>So far, she has published these four books –</strong></p><p><strong>There’s More to Life Than This: Healing Messages, Remarkable Stories, and Insight from the Other Side</strong></p><p>The book was published by Atria in 2013 and debuted at #2 on the New York Times bestseller list. It chronicles <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>her journey</a> as a medium, starting from how she discovered her gift. There are equally stories of her encounters with the Spirit with information about the afterlife and how to connect with a dead loved one. Theresa authored her first book with Kristina Grish.</p><p><strong>You Can’t Make This Stuff Up” Life Changing Lessons from Heaven</strong></p><p>Another piece Theresa co-authored with Kristina Grish, the book was released in 2014. In the book, she shared her experiences and the lessons that came with them in the course of her work as a medium. It is believed by many that reading through the book can help you find peace and closure. Theresa’s second book easily joined the NY Times bestseller list.</p><p><strong>Good Grief Heal Your Soul, Honor Your Loved Ones, and Learn to Live again</strong></p><p>The third book was published in 2017 and is also a NY Times bestseller. She wrote this one by herself, focusing on helping people overcome their grief when tragedy occurs. Her encouraging tone makes it easier for the reader to heal as they read about her lessons and stories from clients.</p><p><strong>Good Mourning: Moving Through Everyday Losses With Wisdom From The Other Side</strong></p><p>Published by HarperCollins, Theresa Caputo’s latest book was released in 2020. Her fourth book teaches how to heal from the inevitable losses we encounter daily. The book emphasizes how people often confuse feelings of grief as depression or anxiety. Once these emotions are identified and tackled accordingly, healing will start.</p><h3><strong>Her Podcast “Hey Spirit”</strong></h3><p>Theresa Caputo is not limiting her audience and source of income to TV. The medium recently launched a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>podcast</a> she named Hey Spirit and the channel has already earned recognition with a nomination for an Ambie Award in the Best Personal Growth Spirituality category.</p><p>She is focusing more on her podcast since the cameras stopped rolling on her reality show on TLC.</p><h2><strong>How Much is a Reading with Theresa Caputo?</strong></h2><p>Theresa Caputo is a medium with a difference. She has monetized her gift to communicate with the spirit, accruing a $3 million net worth at the same time. She reportedly charges $50 to $175 dollars per session, depending on the size of the group.</p><p>She also does individual readings and clients can book her services on a booking website. The problem though is securing a spot with the very busy psychic is not an easy feat.</p><h2><strong>Does Teresa Caputo Still Do Readings?</strong></h2><p>First of all, Theresa Caputo has made it known that she has a two-year waiting list. Thus, booking a reading with her is not that simple as you might have to join a long waiting list.</p><p>To answer the question, yes, Theresa Caputo is still doing her readings but since new episodes of her Long Island Medium show has not been aired since 2019, fans have wondered if she’s still offering such services. For now, she does private readings for those who are interested and she’s still booked to the brim.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I’m back New episode <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/1WJtoexK3b</a></p><p>— Theresa Caputo (@Theresacaputo) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">January 6, 2022</a></p><h2><strong>Theresa Caputo’s Psychic Medium Ability Has Courted Criticisms</strong></h2><p>When you put your life on TV and share personal details with the public, there are bound to be people who would disagree with one or two things. In her own case, Theresa has been accused of being a fake psychic. According to Douglas James Grothe, an American public speaker, and writer, Caputo is a charlatan and her claims are not true.</p><p>Another big critic of her work is the James Randi Education Foundation which gave her the Pigasus Award in April 2012. While that sounds like an honor, the Pigasus Award is targeted at exposing parapsychological, paranormal, or psychic frauds.</p><p>According to Massimo Polidoro, a journalist who investigates paranormal claims, Caputo is just a performer and she’s good at it. In 2013, she was offered $1 million by an illusionist known as Criss Angel to prove her claims but she didn’t take the offer.</p><p>Notwithstanding the criticisms, Theresa Caputo is still making her millions of fans happy by giving them hope of finding peace amid their troubles and grief. She still does private readings but has been busy with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>book deals ad tours</a> since her TV show ended. She also has a podcast titled <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Hey Spirit</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunDAx56pnquRYrCivNStpmaamaR6r7HTZq6oqqSdeqetzKKjsmc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kentaro-seagal-married-wife-children-net-worth-facts-wiki-bio.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kentaro Seagal Married, Wife, Children, Net Worth, Facts, Wiki-Bio">&larr;
