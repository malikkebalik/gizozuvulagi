The Equalizer is a CBS’ crime drama series and reboot of the 1980s of the same name.</p><p>The series — which is also a part of The Equalizer movie franchise starring Denzel Washington — follows Robyn McCall (played by Queen Latifah), also known as the Equalizer, a divorced single mother and former CIA operative who serves as a street vigilante for justice.</p><p>The show premiered in 2021 after the Super Bowl LV and has since become one of CBS’ highest-rated primetime shows with an average of six million viewers each week, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">ShowBuzzDaily</a>. The Equalizer Season 3 premiere, “Truth For a Truth,” ended on an emotional note as the series honored a late member of the show’s family. So who was <a href=# rel=noopener>Kristina Jones from The Equalizer</a>? Read on for what we know so far.</p><h2>Who was Kristina Jones from The Equalizer?</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Equalizer-2.jpg alt="The Equalizer" width=1024 height=599 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Who was Kristina Jones from The Equalizer? Jones was honored in a dedication slide at the end of the Season 4 premiere, “Truth For a Truth.” “In Memory of Kristina Jones,” the slide read. But who was Kristina Jones from The Equalizer?</p><p>Kristina Marie Jones died of cancer on May, 23, 2023, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Sun</a>. She was 53 years old. Her celebration was held at the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Whigham Funeral Home</a> in Newark, New Jersey, one of several cities in northern New Jersey where The Equalizer films. The series also films in cities like Jersey City and Paterson, New Jersey.</p><p>According to an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">obituary</a> for Jones, she was born on November 15, 1969 and was survived by her mother, Cinetta Owens-Feliciano, stepfather David Feliciano, brother Joseph Jones, and uncle Lancelot Owens. “Tina, as she was affectionately called was a beautiful soul who cared deeply and brought happiness to the many lives she touched, the obituary read. Her celebration of life was held on June 7, 2023.</p><p>According to Jones’ uncle, Lancelot Owens, Kristina, who went by Tina, was well known on the set of The Equalizer and she was the closest with lead actress Queen Latifah, who plays Robyn McCall.&nbsp; Jones was one of Queen Latifah’s assistant and helped the COVID-19 team occasionally with testing. “She was on call for whatever Latifah wanted,” Lancelot told The Sun. “Sometimes she had to do different runs for her off-set. She was like her Girl Friday.”</p><p>Lancelot, who also worked on The Equalizer as an advisor, admitted that Kristina and Queen Latifah “loved each other” and “had a great relationship.” “Tina affected everybody [on set] with her approach and how she did everything,” he said. “Her daily slogan was she loved everybody, even if I don’t shake hands.” He added that “everybody came together” at the time of Jones’ death and helped her family as much as they could, including Queen Latifah. “Well that’s a family member… she did what she could. She was there to help,” Lancelot said.</p><p>Lancelot confirmed that Jones worked on at least two seasons of The Equalizer&nbsp;and worked in the background on other productions. He told The Sun that he was glad The Equalizer shed light on the “good person” Jones was. When she wasn’t on set of The Equalizer, Jones volunteered at a church in Poconos in Pennsylvania and helped feed the homeless and mentored young activists.</p><p>The Equalizer&nbsp;is available to stream on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Paramount Plus</a>.</p><p><strong>Check out our gallery below on <a href=# rel=noopener>primetime stars and their children and families in real life</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmp52nqHysvsisq6KmkWK3sLrErGSeqaWWuarGxKtm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./devil-in-ohio-star-s-dating-life-bio-parents-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Devil in Ohio Star's Dating Life, Bio, Parents &amp;amp; Net Worth">&larr;
