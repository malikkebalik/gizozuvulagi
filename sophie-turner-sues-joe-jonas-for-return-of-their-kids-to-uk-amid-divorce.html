He refuses to return the passports to the Mother and refuses to send the children home to England with the Mother.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Sophie Turner is suing her estranged husband, Joe Jonas, to allow their two young kids to return to her “forever home” in England, according to court papers. <span class=credit>BrosNYC / BACKGRID</span></figure><p>Turner has also accused her ex of lying in his&nbsp;Sept. 5&nbsp;divorce filing by claiming the children had lived in Florida for the past six months.</p><p>“The children are fully involved and integrated in all aspects of daily and cultural life in England. The children have extended family and friends in England,” Turner’s suit states.</p><p>“The children receive routine medical care and dental care in England. The older child attends school in England. Both children participate in extracurricular activities, playdates, and cultural activities in England.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The estranged couple’s children, ages 3 and 1, are being wrongfully retained in New York City, the lawsuit alleges. <span class=credit>BACKGRID</span></figure><p>Turner listed off a slew of places the family have&nbsp;rented around the world since Sept. 2022&nbsp;– including New York, Italy, London and Florida, and noted she’s now “temporarily” staying with her daughters at a five-star Manhattan hotel.</p><p>She plans&nbsp;to file a similar lawsuit in the UK.</p><p>“Sophie is making this claim only to move the divorce proceedings to the UK and to remove the children from the U.S. permanently,” a rep for Jonas said in a statement to The Post Thursday.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The couple has filed for divorce after being married for four years. <span class=credit>AFP via Getty Images</span></figure><p>The Florida court where Jonas filed for divorce has already ruled that neither parents can relocate the kids, an order that Turner was given on Sept. 6, the spokesperson said.</p><p>The pair&nbsp;“had a cordial meeting”&nbsp;in New York City this past Sunday and Jonas thought “they had reached an understanding that they would work together towards an amicable co-parenting setup,” according to the statement.</p><p>But less than a day later, Turner changed her tune and “demanded” the kids’ passports so she could immediately take them to England – a move that would violate the Florida court order, the rep claimed.</p><p>Jonas wants to raise the kids with Turner and would agree to the kids being raised in both countries, his spokesperson said.</p><p>Turner’s petition specifies that the girls have dual US and UK citizenship.</p><p>The rep said that Turner’s use of federal international child abduction laws to file her suit is misleading.</p><p>“The children were not abducted,” the statement states, adding that “[Jonas’]&nbsp;wish is that Sophie reconsider her harsh legal position and move forward in a more constructive and private manner</p><p>“His only concern is the well-being of his children.”</p><p>Reps for Turner did not return a request for comment.</p><p>The stars started dating back in 2016 and wed in a Las Vegas ceremony three years later.</p><p>They welcomed their daughter, Willa, in July 2020 and a second daughter, whose name they have not disclosed, two years later.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Jma2lfqLyxtMieZK2toqOys3nSrpysZZqksm62zqeYrGWWpL9uvsStrKumXaSzbsDHnqCrZZOdtq2w0Z6lZqyfYrKvs8uapZ1lkah6pbXVqKmcnV2XrrXAy55koZ2RqcBuwc9o</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./photos-jenna-ushkowitz-michael-trevino-glee-tvd-stars-hollywood-life.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="[PHOTOS] Jenna Ushkowitz &amp;amp; Michael Trevino  Glee &amp;amp; TVD Stars  Hollywood Life">&larr;
