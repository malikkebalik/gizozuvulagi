After a quick marriage, she seduced Ross Marler and then began a string of affairs. When he repaid her with an affair of his own and threats of a split, she attempted suicide. After her stomach was pumped, a guilt stricken Ross returned to her while she began eying her doctor Ed Bauer. Meanwhile, she became involved in a murderous blackmail ring which doomed her relationship with the doctor. She left town for awhile, but became involved with her father's attempt to take over Spaulding. During this time, Vanessa discovered that she had a brother she'd never known about. She went in search of him only to discover that he was her father's aid Quint. As the family traded blackmails, she managed to alienate herself from the business, but tried to reconcile after her brother was almost killed in an accident.</p><p>Soon after, she fell for Billy Lewis, realizing that behind his would-be cowboy personality he was as spoiled as she was. While they were quickly engaged, he found himself swayed by ex-wife Reva while she was being charmed by Alan. Sick of jealousy, he threw her over his shoulder and married her in a speedy service. But the marriage was full of addiction, she to tranquilizers and he to gambling and yet he was devoted enough to cover up for her after she ran over a pregnant Reva while she was stoned. The marriage was also complicated when she tried to reconcile with newly discovered daughter Dinah. Through the ordeal of Dinah's kidnapping, Vanessa moved from Billy to Ross to Alan before simply leaving for Venezuela. She returned a few years later to get back with Billy only to be left at the altar when he started drinking and had an affair with Nadine Cooper. Still continuing in the business, she did what she did best and blackmailed her way to the top of Spaulding and made her way back to Billy. This time they made it to the altar, but she left him when he went back to drinking and was convicted of attempted murder. She left to get away and ended up stranded on an island with Matt, with whom she fell in love. Anxious about the differences in their ages however, she abandoned the young man only to reunite with him later, just in time for the troublesome return of her daughter Dinah.</p><p>Even after their marriage, Vanessa was worried about Matt and her suspicions were confirmed when she discovered that he used to be an escort. Almost simultaneously, she discovered that she had a brain disease and faked her own death so her family wouldn't have to deal with it. She received treatment in secret and made a miraculous recovery as Matt searched the world for her. He returned to town to finish their dream home and she arrived just as it was completed. They went through a difficult pregnancy which almost killed her fragile body and, though she recovered, she became insecure and jealous. Unfortunately, her concerns for Bill Lewis led her into dangerous proximity to killer Ben Reade. Running away from one of his crime scenes, she was in a car accident and went into a coma to be nursed back by Matt. The couple left but would return sporadically to check on Dinah when they learned of her erratic behavior. While she reconciled with many friends who she had alienated over the years, she and Matt were drawn back to town permanently to keep an eye on Dinah and her fianc AC Mallet. She's bought the local television station and set them in competition with their own shows.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmoK2Zmbavs4yloKCgpGSwqa3RmpqtnaKofLetzZ6qrJldmLWiucGeqaWZmaN6rbHWoqpmqpWWv6W7zWg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-dawn-morante-tiktok-next-influencer-cast-age-and-wiki.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Dawn Morante TikTok?
