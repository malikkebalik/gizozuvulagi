Mina is a tv personality who appears on HGTV's reality shows, <i>Good Bones, A Very Brady Renovation, and Rock the Block</i>.</p><p>Stephen (Steve) Hawk was born on <i>November 2, 1981,</i> in the United States. His father was <strong>Richard Hawk</strong>, while his mother was <strong>Sally Hawk</strong>. Steve has a brother named, <strong>Christopher Hawk</strong>, while his sister, <strong>Stefanie</strong> died in early 2020. Talking about his education, Hawk attended Indiana University Bloomington. He is not related to the skateboarder, <strong>Tony Hawk</strong>.</p><h2>Four Years of Marriage with Wife</h2><p>Steve and his wife, <a href=#><strong>Mina Starsiak</strong></a> exchanged their wedding vows on <i>June 11, 2016,</i> in Indianapolis, Indiana. The reception party took place at the city's 1899 building. Further, the couple served 400 donuts to guests instead of the wedding cake.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/12/20/StvMin-1608471692645.jpg><p>The couple married after three years of relationship. Steve had proposed to his future wife in 2015 sending her on a scavenger hunt. Afterward, he popped the question on the 50-yard-line of the Indianapolis Colts' training field.</p><h2>Steve made "Not-So-Good" First Impression</h2><p>It was Mina who first noticed Steve on social media. They <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>connected</strong></a> through mutual friends on Facebook. Soon, they went out on a group date to see a baseball game. Although Mina found Steve incredibly handsome, the tattooed-hunk paid no attention to her. Mina recalls the moment: <i>"He ignored me all night. He let his friends hit on me."</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/12/20/stmn-1608471970214.jpg><p>Nevertheless, Mina decided to give him a second chance. She got his number and texted: <i>"We're going to try this again tomorrowâ€”you get one more shot."</i> The pair struggled in the initial phase of their relationship, broke up for a while but later got back together. This way, Steve nearly blew up the chance to marry that right person.</p><h2>Steve and Mina's Kids</h2><p>After two years of marriage, Steve and his spouse welcomed their first child, a son named, <strong>Jack Richard Hawk</strong> on <i>August 9, 2018</i>. However, Mina struggled to get pregnant a second time. She tried acupuncture and fertility bracelet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/12/20/steveson-1608472265045.jpg><p>Further, Mina shared her IVF journey on Good Bones and regularly updated her fans about the pregnancy. The home renovator revealed during that time she felt a lot of anxiety.</p><p>Luckily, the couple's second child, daughter, <strong>Charlotte Drew Hawk</strong> was born on <i>September 16, 2020</i>. Her middle name Drew was picked to honor one of Steve's late friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/12/20/stevedaughter-1608472353309.jpg><p>At present, the family of four is happy and healthy. Before their two kids, Hawk and Starsiak parented their niece, <strong>Julie</strong> as her foster parents.</p><h2>Who is Mina Starsiak?
