He was born Maxwell Young on December 9, 2006, in the United States. He is an American citizen born under the Saggitarius birth sign and inherited mixed roots from his parents.</p><p>He is the first child born to Dave and Laura DeShazor-Dunn, who raised him in the Christian faith, which he has embraced to date. Bunchie often writes Bible verses on his arm and also takes part in church activities at the Love and Live Again Ministries in Los Angeles.</p><p>Meanwhile, he has kept the public in the dark about what his parents do for a living. He has a younger sister with whom he shares the same parents and he currently resides in Los Angeles with his father. Bunchie Young attends a public charter learning institution in Los Angeles known as the KIPP Scholar Academy.</p><h2><strong>Who are Bunchie Young’s Parents?</strong></h2><p>Bunchie Young’s parents are Dave (father) and Laura DeShazor-Dunn (mother). Though they are famed for being related to Bunchie, little is known about them. Nothing is known about their ages as there are no records of their date, month, and year of birth. Further details about their individual families and educational backgrounds are also scarce and the same goes for what they do for a living at the moment.</p><p>However, it’s known that Dave is quite supportive of his son, Bunchie, and has been his driving force. He was the one who noticed Bunchie’s unique skills when he was only three years old. This happened when he saw him race down the driveway at an unusual speed. Since then, Dave made it a duty to help him train to become exceptional when he goes professional.</p><p>On the part of Laura DeShazor-Dunn, all that is known about her is that she is a great mother who has been supportive of her family. She is always there for Bunchie after school hours to pick him up and also help him solve his assignment during her daily launch break.</p><h3><strong>Bunchie Young’s Parents Are Divorced</strong></h3><p>Bunchie Young’s parents are no longer married. There is no information about how they met or how long they dated before getting married. Further details about when they got married and how long they were married are also scarce.</p><p>All that is known is that they got divorced after being married for some time, however, the reason for their divorce is not known. Other details such as whether the divorce was settled amicably or outside the court have never been revealed.</p><p>It is also not known if any of them was given full custody of their children, however, Bunchie Young currently lives with his father because of his career. This notwithstanding, his relationship with both parents has been strong, as they both spend a fair share of time with him.</p><h2><strong>What Sport Does Bunchie Young Play?</strong></h2><p>Bunchie Young plays football. Prior to exploring the sport, he became a part of the Hub City Tar Heels Young Football Organization, where he plays with other aspiring football players. The young star began his career exploration at three years old as he has been extensively trained by his father earlier.</p><p>When Bunchie was 3 years old, he witnessed his first football game. At the age of 4, he was already good at catching an NFL-sized football. By the time he clocked 6 years, he had won a 200-meter race, emerging as the winner in just 32.22 seconds, giving the second person a 3.5-second gap.</p><p>His father registered him in a gym in Norwalk, California, where he trains with Mike Evans to boost his strength, stamina, and agility. He also trains with Jonathan Ligons, a speed coach. Currently, he trains at a professional training facility known as the STARS, located in Los Angeles.</p><p>By the age of 10 years, he had set a back-breaking record for the 100-yard dash with a time of 12.4 seconds. He earned the title of Sports Illustrated SportsKid of the Year when he turned 11 years old for hitting 61 touchdowns in one and a half seasons of youth football. Due to his achievement, he has been to several interview sessions and was cast in an episode of No Days Off produced by Whistle’s YouTube channel, which garnered lots of views.</p><p>Bunchie Young also starred as the star of the NFL 100 commercial that ran during Super Bowl LIV on Sunday. His prowess at his age earned him a scholarship at the Univerity of Illinois to play for them.</p><p>With Bunchie Young’s extraordinary skills, he will surely make it to the professional level as he aspires to play for the NFL in the future. He also has other dreams that he wishes to achieve while pursuing his football career; he wants to be the youngest footballer to make it to the Olympics, become a sports broadcaster, and own an NFL team.</p><p>However, the youngster also has some athletes that he looks up to. He revealed that he looks up to Usain Bolt because he is the fastest athlete, Bo Jackson because of his strength and speed, and Barry Sanders because he is swift and fast.</p><h2><strong>Meet Bunchie Young’s Sister, Maxine Young</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/maxine.jpg><p>Maxine Young is Bunchie’s younger sister. She was born to his parents before their divorce. Though her birth details at the moment are scarce, some reports have it that she is around 11 years old. She also attends school in Los Angeles, but the name of the institution she attends is not known.</p><p>Maxine is quite close to her brother and accompanies him to most of his trainings. Though she is not showing any interest in sports yet, it is believed that with time, her brother might influence her love for sports.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunDDx6hkoqtdl8Kvr8einGaxn6q7qHnApaNmmZKkwrV506GcZrGfqruoecCnm2aekaK8tr%2BMmqSeqpmYrq95xaimrZqRobluvMuasJ6qXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-jessica-reed-kraus-influencer-claims-johnny-depp-moaned-about-msm-s-lack-of-integrity.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Jessica Reed Kraus?
