Gavaris is popularly known for his role on the TV series, Orphan Black.</p><p>Jordan has recently come out to the public as gay and also revealed some personal information about his relationship. Know more about Jordan in the following article.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Jordan_Gavaris></span>Who is Jordan Gavaris?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Jordan James Gavaris</strong>, more popularly known as Jordan Gavaris was born on September 25, 1989, in Caledon, Ontario, Canada. He is the youngest child of a Greek immigrant father and a Canadian mother who&nbsp;is of northern European descent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/jordan-gavaris.jpg><p>Jordan attended Mayfield Secondary School and graduated from there while having an interest in movie direction early in his life.</p><p>Gavaris made his debut in the movie G2G: Got to Go! in which he gave voice to the character <strong>Barry</strong>. However, his actual feature film debut came in the same year 2008, when he portrayed the character of <strong>Parry Tender</strong> in the movie 45 R.P.M.</p><p><strong>Also read: <a class=yoast-link-suggestion__value href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who plays Mr. Heckles in F.R.I.E.N.D.S? Know more.</a></strong></p><p>Jordan has 14 credits to his name as an actor to date, with three of the projects in the stage of post-production. He is most famous for his portrayal of <strong>Felix Dawkins</strong> on the TV series Orphan Black. The series ran from 2013 to 2017&nbsp;and received many positive critical responses.</p><p>Gavaris has worked in various other productions like Take Two (TV series) (2018), Unnatural History (TV series) (2010), The Sea of Trees (2015) (Movie), and many more.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jordan_Gavaris%E2%80%99s_Personal_Life_Is_He_In_A_Relationship></span><span id=Brett_Daverns_Personal_Life_Is_He_Married class=ez-toc-section><span id=Richard_Sammels_Personal_Life_Who_Is_He_Married_To class=ez-toc-section>Jordan Gavaris’s Personal Life: Is He In A Relationship?</span></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jordan Gavaris, much to the disappointment of many lady fans out there, is gay and is in a relationship with <strong>Devon Graye</strong>. They have been in a romantic relationship since 2013, but Jordan revealed this only very&nbsp;recently.</p><p>Jordan was named one of Playback Magazine‘s Top Ten to Watch for 2010. Past names have included <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Nina Dobrev</strong></a> and <strong>Xavier Dolan</strong>.</p><h3>Breaking the news and breaking hearts</h3><p>While it might have been very hard for Jordan’s female fans to know that he is gay, the actor himself actually&nbsp;hid the secret from the mainstream media for a very&nbsp;long time.</p><p>Jordan revealed that he was gay to his family when he was 19, but admits that he was never asked about his sexual orientation before an interview on Vulture.</p><p><strong>It’s a scary thing to </strong><strong>have to</strong>&nbsp;<strong>own who you are publicly. I think that’s largely why I waited. I </strong><strong>always kind</strong><strong> of knew if somebody asked I would </strong><strong>start<span class=widont>&nbsp;</span>talking</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p>Jordan finally came out to the public back in February of 2017, when he was finally asked about his sexuality. He said in the interview that&nbsp;it shouldn’t matter if he is gay or not in the show business. He also admitted that he thinks he will get fewer parts in movies just because he is gay.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jordan_Gavaris%E2%80%99s_Net_Worth_How_Much_Does_He_Earn></span><span id=Brett_Daverns_Net_Worth_How_Much_Does_He_Earn class=ez-toc-section><span id=Richard_Sammels_Net_Worth_How_Much_Does_He_Earn class=ez-toc-section>Jordan Gavaris’s Net Worth: How Much Does He Earn?</span></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jordan Gavaris has an estimated net worth of about <strong>$1 million</strong>.

Typically, an average model earns in the range of <strong>$9</strong> per hour, however, as he is an established model cum actor, he should have received around <strong>$15</strong> – <strong>$20</strong> per hour.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jordan_Gavaris_Body_Measurements></span><span id=Brett_Davern_Body_Measurements class=ez-toc-section><span id=Richard_Sammel_Body_Measurements class=ez-toc-section><span id=John_Campea_Body_Measurements class=ez-toc-section>Jordan Gavaris: Body Measurements</span></span></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jordan Gavaris is a handsome guy with a height of 5′ 10″ (1.78 m).
