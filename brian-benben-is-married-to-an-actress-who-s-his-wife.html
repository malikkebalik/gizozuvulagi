The American actor with a courteous character has credited in 27 movies to date.</p><p>Besides Dream On, he has also appeared in a medical drama series Private Practice. To know more about the star’s personal life, stick with the article.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Married_to_an_Actress></span>Married to an Actress<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The star is in a marital relationship with <strong>Madeleine Stowe</strong>. Madeleine is also a talented actress like Brian himself.</p><ul class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-1 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex"><li class=blocks-gallery-item><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Brian-Benden-Madeleine-Stowe.jpg></li></ul><p>The duo first crossed path while filming for the show The Gangster Chronicles. They co-starred as husband and wife in the short-lived TV show.</p><p>Ultimately, they found a connection in-between and started dating. After dating for some time they realized they were ready to spend the rest of their lives together in real life as well and tied the knot on 8 August 1982.</p><ul class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-3 is-layout-flex"><li class=blocks-gallery-item><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MadeleineStoweMadeleineStoweFamilyOuto82XtrqkDYxl-1.jpg></li></ul><p>The Benbens share a beautiful daughter, <strong>May Theodora Benben </strong>who was born in 1996. Theodora is a Psychology graduate of Duke University. It seems the couple prefers a rather small family and is happy with only a single kid.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Robbed_of_75000_Worth_of_Jewelry></span>Robbed of $75,000 Worth of Jewelry<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In May of 2016, news arose that the couple was robbed at gunpoint at their own home. The duo was soundly asleep when they were awoken by ruckus coming from their bathroom.</p><p>Naked, Stowe went towards the sound to discover an unknown man. The wife was eager to understand what was happening when the unknown figure pointed a gun towards her. The robber then demanded money to which she denied at first but later had to submit to the gun carried by the man.</p><ul class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-5 is-layout-flex"><li class=blocks-gallery-item><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/0374458252b84895ffd07ce8bc36b4a8-1.jpg></li></ul><p>The 61-year-old handed over an antique jewelry collection that was reportedly worth over <strong>$75,000</strong>. After acquiring the jewelry, the robber made a run for it. The frightened couple, wasting no time, reported the police right after the incident but the culprit was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>After a series of investigations, the police arrested the suspect <strong>Walter Canizalez </strong>for the breach. Turns out, the suspect was also involved in 15 similar home invasion cases. The court later granted Stowe a protective order against Walter.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Benben%E2%80%99s_Seven_Figure_Net_Worth></span>Benben’s Seven Figure Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Brian Benben owns a net worth of whopping <strong>$8 million</strong>. The actor is best recognized for his performance in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="HBO (opens in a new tab)">HBO</a> television series Dream On as Martin Tupper.</p><p>The man also starred in the TV series Private Practice for the role of <strong>Dr. Sheldon Wallace </strong>in 2008. He also produced a sitcom,<strong> </strong>The Brian Benben Show on September 21, 1998, which didn’t last very long, ending after only a month of airing.</p><p><strong>YouTube: The Brian BenBen show Promo</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Brian started working on his dream of becoming an actor from an early age of 17. He performed in the off-off-Broadway shows in New York. Later in 1983, he made an appearance in Slab Boys with <strong>Kevin Bacon</strong>,<strong> Sean Penn</strong>, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Val Kilmer (opens in a new tab)">Val Kilmer</a></strong>, and <strong>Jackie Earle Haley</strong>. However, his first TV debut would be in The Gangster Chronicles.</p><p>The star’s wife Madeleine also has a net worth of <strong>$15 million </strong>which is almost twice the net worth of her husband. The actress earns a paycheck of <strong>$75,000</strong> per episode of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="ABC (opens in a new tab)">ABC </a>show Revenge. We can say the robber took away an episode worth of her shooting.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Owner of a Ranch</h3><p>The partners in crime live in a two-story house made out of limestone located in Texas. The house stands on a 400-acre cattle ranch which they own.</p><ul class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-7 is-layout-flex"><li class=blocks-gallery-item><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/UHBVxhGaFThk0qPkXPvuY3iWoI-1.jpg></li></ul><p>Brian’s wife came across the ranch while taking a drive, so as to take a break from her stuffy shooting schedule. She stumbled across the landmark while driving northeast from Brackettville toward the Hill Country. She instantly fell in love with the location and penned her name into the ownership papers in 1994.</p><p>The ranch is home to several lively animals as antelopes, horses, swans, and sheep. Stowe named her favorite horse Sherman. They insist the family take care of the ranch in “the Cowboy way.”</p><p>Catch more about your favorite celebrities on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="TheCelebsCloset (opens in a new tab)">TheCelebsCloset</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwprjEm6qcpJ%2BosrV6wqikaJqinq6vecGepZudnmK2tHnMmqmroZWZerW7jJqlZpmTqb%2Bmv9JmrqGno2K1qr%2BMsKCfnV8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jake-roberts-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jake Roberts Net Worth">&larr;
